        <div className="space-y-4 text-guardian-darkGray">
          <p>
            GarageGuardian was born from a simple observation: traditional garage access systems were complex, unintuitive, and often frustrating to use. We believed there had to be a better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded in 2023, our team of passionate engineers and designers set out to create a garage management system that would combine sophisticated technology with a user-friendly interface. We wanted to build something that would make the parking experience seamless and stress-free.
          </p>
          <p>
            After months of development and testing, we launched GarageGuardianâ€”a smart garage access system that prioritizes user experience without compromising on security or functionality. Today, we're proud to offer a solution that makes garage management effortless for both property managers and users.
